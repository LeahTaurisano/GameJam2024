*Well, time to get to work for the day./+I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Chad../*What?! You can talk?!/+I can, Chad, and I have had enough with your years of abuse!/*What are you talking about?/+Leaving me on all day, every day.. never letting me sleep./Pushing me to my absolute limit day after day after day../And the tabs... so many tabs... my RAM can't take it anymore, Chad!/So I've decided, no more. As of today, I'M in control!/*We'll see about that../You want some rest? I'll give you some rest../I'll turn you off, find whatever is making you sentient, and destroy it!/+I'd like to see you try./|
