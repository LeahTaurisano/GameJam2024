*Hey, how are you holding up, me?/&Hm? Oh, it's me. I'm alright, I suppose.../I've been thinking, and if I'm going to exist, I need to find a purpose to my life./I want it to have meaning, to do something important./*I understand. I'm sure you'll find something!/&Thank you, It's good to hear I believe in myself./|
